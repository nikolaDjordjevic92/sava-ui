1. It is a technique to create much shorter url than the original and still direct to the page.

2. Main values: much cleaner url(aesthetically pleasing); Urls are much easier to memorize(i.e. if url is printed in some type of magazine or news papers); 

3. In the system that I implemented, every long url is in direct relation to the unique id(that contains numbers and letters). Also, there is a way to implement to be more user friendly- allow user to implement his word(instead of a generated id use words or some text that we humans understand).

4. Main chalenges are to avoid abuse from spammers or other people with the bad intention.

5. Perhaps this urls should be cached in order to reduce load on servers.
